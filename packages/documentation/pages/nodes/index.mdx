**Available Nodes on the Generators and Resolver playground**

Here are some of the available nodes:

| Node groups   |                                                            Use |
| :------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Generic       |              These contain generic nodes like input and output |
| Math          |                                        Mathematical operations |
| Array         | Nodes that operate on arrays, ie ordered collections of values |
| Sets          |                              Nodes that operate on tokens sets |
