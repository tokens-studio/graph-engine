# Strong Typing

## Context and Problem Statement

Inputs and outputs should be strongly typed for users with typescript, etc , but also to enable automatic type conversions between nodes and to limit connections.

Typing has to be runtime because of the dynamic nature of the graph engine.

Typing should follow the declarative model we have, but it also needs to support dynamic inputs
